pg-boss is a job queue built in Node.js on top of PostgreSQL in order to provide background processing and reliable asynchronous execution to Node.js applications.

pg-boss relies on [SKIP LOCKED](http://blog.2ndquadrant.com/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5), a feature introduced in PostgreSQL 9.5 written specifically for message queues, in order to resolve record locking challenges inherent with relational databases. This brings the safety of guaranteed atomic commits of a relational database to your asynchronous job processing.

This will likely cater the most to teams already familiar with the simplicity of relational database semantics and operations (SQL, querying, and backups). It will be especially useful to those already relying on PostgreSQL that want to limit how many systems are required to monitor and support in their architecture.

## Features
* Backpressure-compatible subscriptions for monitoring queues on an interval (with configurable concurrency)
* Distributed cron-based job scheduling with database clock synchronization
* Job deferral, retries (with exponential backoff), throttling, rate limiting, debouncing
* Job completion subscriptions for orchestrations/sagas
* Direct publish, fetch and completion APIs for custom integrations
* Batching API for chunked job fetching
* Direct table access for bulk loads via COPY or INSERT
* Multi-master compatible when running multiple instances (for example, in a Kubernetes ReplicaSet)
* Automatic provisioning of required storage into a dedicated schema
* Automatic maintenance operations to manage table growth

## Requirements
* Node 12 or higher
* PostgreSQL 9.5 or higher

## Installation

``` bash
# npm
npm install pg-boss

# yarn
