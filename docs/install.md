# Database install <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

pg-boss will automatically create a dedicated schema (`pgboss` is the default name) in the target database. This will require the user in database connection to have the [CREATE](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/static/sql-grant.html) privilege.

```sql
GRANT CREATE ON DATABASE db1 TO leastprivuser;
```

If the CREATE privilege is not available or desired, you can use the included [static functions](#static-functions) to export the SQL commands to manually create or upgrade the required database schema.  **This means you will also need to monitor future releases for schema changes** (the schema property in [version.json](../version.json)) so they can be applied manually.

NOTE: Using an existing schema is supported for advanced use cases **but discouraged**, as this opens up the possibility that creation will fail on an object name collision, and it will add more steps to the uninstallation process.

# Database uninstall

If you need to uninstall pg-boss from a database, just run the following command.

```sql
DROP SCHEMA $1 CASCADE
```

Where `$1` is the name of your schema if you've customized it.  Otherwise, the default schema is `pgboss`.

NOTE: If an existing schema was used during installation, created objects will need to be removed manually using the following commands.

```sql
DROP TABLE pgboss.version;
DROP TABLE pgboss.job;
DROP TABLE pgboss.archive;
DROP TYPE pgboss.job_state;
DROP TABLE pgboss.subscription;
DROP TABLE pgboss.schedule;
DROP FUNCTION pgboss.create_queue;
DROP FUNCTION pgboss.delete_queue;
DROP TABLE pgboss.queue;
```
