# Proxy

A HTTP proxy is available in the [`@pg-boss/proxy`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pg-boss/proxy) package if needed to support use cases such as platform compatibility and connection pooling or scalability.

See the [proxy documentation](https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss/blob/master/packages/proxy/README.md) for full configuration and deployment options.
