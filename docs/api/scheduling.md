# Scheduling

Jobs may be created automatically based on a cron expression. As with other cron-based systems, at least one instance needs to be running for scheduling to work. In order to reduce the amount of evaluations, schedules are checked every 30 seconds, which means the 6-placeholder format should be discouraged in favor of the minute-level precision 5-placeholder format.

For example, use this format, which implies "any second during 3:30 am every day"

```
30 3 * * *
```

but **not** this format which is parsed as "only run exactly at 3:30:30 am every day"

```
30 30 3 * * *
```

To change how often schedules are checked, you can set `cronMonitorIntervalSeconds`. To change how often cron jobs are run, you can set `cronWorkerIntervalSeconds`.

In order mitigate clock skew and drift, every 10 minutes the clocks of each instance are compared to the database server's clock. The skew, if any, is stored and used as an offset during cron evaluation to ensure all instances are synchronized. Internally, job throttling options are then used to make sure only 1 job is sent even if multiple instances are running.

If needed, the default clock monitoring interval can be adjusted using `clockMonitorIntervalSeconds` or `clockMonitorIntervalMinutes`. Additionally, to disable scheduling on an instance completely, use the following in the constructor options.

```js
{
  schedule: false
}
```

For more cron documentation and examples see the docs for the [cron-parser package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron-parser).

### `schedule(name, cron, data, options)`

Schedules a job to be sent to the specified queue based on a cron expression. If the schedule already exists, it's updated to the new cron expression.

**Arguments**

- `name`: string, *required*
- `cron`: string, *required*
- `data`: object
- `options`: object

`options` supports all properties in `send()` and an optional `tz` property that specifies a time zone name. If not specified, the default is UTC.

For example, the following code will send a job at 3:00am in the US central time zone into the queue `notification-abc`.

```js
await boss.schedule('notification-abc', `0 3 * * *`, null, { tz: 'America/Chicago' })
```

### `unschedule(name)`

Removes a schedule by queue name.

### `getSchedules()`

Retrieves an array of all scheduled jobs currently being monitored.
